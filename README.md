# Models-to-predict-house-prices
**Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, and market trends.
**Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Joblib for model persistence.
**Key Features:**
1.Preprocessed real estate data including handling missing values and scaling features.
2.Implemented multiple machine learning models: Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.
3.Conducted model evaluation using metrics like mean and standard deviation to compare performance.
**Challenges and Solutions:**
Challenge: Variability in data affecting model performance.
Solution: Utilized RandomForestRegressor to improve accuracy and reduce variance, achieving a mean of 3.30 with a standard deviation of 0.71, outperforming other modelsâ€‹
